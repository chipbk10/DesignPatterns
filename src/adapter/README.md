### Adapter Pattern

- allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate

### Applicability

- Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isnâ€™t compatible with the rest of your code.
- The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class
