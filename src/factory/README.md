### Factory Pattern

- we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface

### Abstract Factory Pattern

- provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Dependency Injection

- allows the creation of dependent objects outside of the class and provides those objects to the class through different ways (constructors, setter methods)
