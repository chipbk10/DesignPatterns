### Strategy Pattern

- anti-switch solution
- define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable at runtime.

### Strategy vs Decorator

- Strategy pattern allows to change the implementation of something used at runtime.
- Decorator pattern allows you augment (or add to) existing functionality with additional functionality at run time.
- The key difference is in the change vs augment

### Strategy + Factory

- go hand-in-hand
